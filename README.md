## How does it work?
Anyone can use *Lit Bayou* to search for movies and television shows (powered by The Movie Database API). In order to get the most out of it though, you'll need to sign up and log in. From there you can add movies and shows to your shelf, write reviews, and make lists of your favorites. You can also add friends and see what they've been watching and enjoying/hating!

### Searching

The user profile page is separated into three parts: lists, shelf, and reviews. 

Users can create any kind of list they want â€” Top 10, Favorites, Best Slasher Films, etc.

The shelf is for media that the user has seen or would like to watch. A blue check mark icon indicates that the user has watched that film or show before.

Users can also write reviews, which will show up on their profile page in truncated format. To view the entire review, you can click on the review title.
